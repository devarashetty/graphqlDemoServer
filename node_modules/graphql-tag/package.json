  "readme": "# graphql-tag\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-tag.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphql-tag)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apollographql/graphql-tag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apollographql/graphql-tag)\n[![Get on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-orange.svg)](http://www.apollodata.com/#slack)\n\nGraphQL printing and parsing with bundled dependencies. Includes:\n\n- `gql` A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.\n- `/parser` A bundled version of `graphql/language/parser`, that builds correctly in React Native.\n- `/printer` A bundled version of `graphql/language/printer`, that builds correctly in React Native.\n- `/loader` A webpack loader to preprocess queries\n\n### gql\n\nThis is a template literal tag you can use to concisely write a GraphQL query that is parsed into the standard GraphQL AST:\n\n```js\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nconst query = gql`\n  {\n    user(id: 5) {\n      firstName\n      lastName\n    }\n  }\n`\n\n// query is now a GraphQL syntax tree object\nconsole.log(query);\n\n// {\n//   \"kind\": \"Document\",\n//   \"definitions\": [\n//     {\n//       \"kind\": \"OperationDefinition\",\n//       \"operation\": \"query\",\n//       \"name\": null,\n//       \"variableDefinitions\": null,\n//       \"directives\": [],\n//       \"selectionSet\": {\n//         \"kind\": \"SelectionSet\",\n//         \"selections\": [\n//           {\n//             \"kind\": \"Field\",\n//             \"alias\": null,\n//             \"name\": {\n//               \"kind\": \"Name\",\n//               \"value\": \"user\",\n//               ...\n```\n\nYou can easily explore GraphQL ASTs on [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/#/drYr8X1rnP/1).\n\nThis package is the way to pass queries into [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollostack/apollo-client). If you're building a GraphQL client, you can use it too!\n\n#### Why use this?\n\nGraphQL strings are the right way to write queries in your code, because they can be statically analyzed using tools like [eslint-plugin-graphql](https://github.com/apollostack/eslint-plugin-graphql). However, strings are inconvenient to manipulate, if you are trying to do things like add extra fields, merge multiple queries together, or other interesting stuff.\n\nThat's where this package comes in - it lets you write your queries with [ES2015 template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and compile them into an AST with the `gql` tag.\n\n#### Caching parse results\n\nThis package only has one feature - it caches previous parse results in a simple dictionary. This means that if you call the tag on the same query multiple times, it doesn't waste time parsing it again. It also means you can use `===` to compare queries to check if they are identical.\n\n### Webpack preprocessing\n\nThis package also includes a [webpack loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html). There are many benefits over this approach, which saves GraphQL ASTs processing time on client-side and enable queries to be separated from script over `.graphql` files.\n\n```js\nloaders: [\n  {\n    test: /\\.(graphql|gql)$/,\n    exclude: /node_modules/,\n    loader: 'graphql-tag/loader'\n  }\n]\n```\n\nthen:\n\n```js\nimport query from './query.graphql';\n\nconsole.log(query);\n// {\n//   \"kind\": \"Document\",\n// ...\n```\n\nTesting environments that don't support Webpack require additional configuration. For [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) use [jest-transform-graphql](https://github.com/remind101/jest-transform-graphql).\n\n\n### Parser and printer\n\nThis package also includes two submodules: `graphql-tag/printer` and `graphql-tag/parser`, which are bundled versions of the corresponding modules from the standard `graphql` package. These are included because the `graphql` package currently doesn't build in **React Native**. Use them the same way you would use the relevant modules from `graphql`:\n\n```js\nimport { parse } from 'graphql-tag/parser';\nimport { print } from 'graphql-tag/printer';\n```\n\n#### Why are these included in the source on GitHub?\n\nWe generate the bundles for the printer and parser with Webpack from the `graphql` package. You might notice the bundles are included in the package source on GitHub. This is to enable easy installation from a Git URL in cases where that is helpful. In the case of updates to `graphql` printing or parsing (which should be very rare since the syntax is stable at this point), we will be able to easily run the build script and republish.\n",
